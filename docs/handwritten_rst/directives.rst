.. _directives-label:

Test page for directives
========================

I will just show some directives here as examples and to get the page full. 

More information about the directives can be found in the `Sphinx documentation <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/directives.html>`_

.. warning::

   This is a warning telling you to be cautious because of something.

.. seealso::
   You can find more information somewhere. For example on the homepage of the `Sphinx project <https://www.sphinx-doc.org>`_


Some potential nice features that seem to be unsupported by my current version of sphinx (1.3.2), but the features might still work on readthedocs.

.. versionadded:: v42

   A new feature was added in v42

.. deprecated:: v42

   There is something in the new version that changed and will be removed in newer versions!
